## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Create and navigate into a new directory anywhere on your file system through the command line. Then, run the following command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keerthisree-raghu/JustWrite.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the following command.

## Usage

### Development Server

Navigate into the `backend` folder and run `node server.js` to start the backend server. Keep this server running while running the frontend development server.

Run `ng serve` from the root folder for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
